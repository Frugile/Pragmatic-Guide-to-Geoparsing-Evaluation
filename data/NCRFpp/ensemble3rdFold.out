has 0
widespread 0

the 0

is 0

Here 0
we 0

this 0

not 0
done 0
regularly 0

within 0

we 0
have 0
recruited 0
more 0

“ 0

By 0
so 0
doing 0
, 0
we 0
have 0
given 0

we 0
have 0
strengthened 0

“ 0

If 0
I 0
am 0

put 0
it 0

there 0
was 0

within 0
the 0

we 0
have 0

able 0

more 0

we 0
are 0

for 0

but 0
we 0
believe 0

” 0

AMLO 0
’s 0
position 0
on 0
NAFTA 0
has 0
been 0
somewhat 0
unclear 0
throughout 0
his 0
campaign 0

hence 0
his 0
pitch 0
to 0
worried 0
investors 0
who 0
fear 0
that 0
an 0
anti 0

NAFTA 0
Mexican S-Entity
president 0

significantly 0
slow 0

AMLO 0
also 0
claims 0
in 0

that 0
he 0
will 0
, 0
“ 0

Ironically 0
, 0
this 0
type 0

hearkens 0
back 0

Of 0

this 0

could 0
ultimately 0
be 0
a 0
disservice 0
to 0

in 0

NAFTA 0

largely 0

economists 0

be 0
an 0

success 0
for 0

have 0
skyrocketed 0

with 0

dramatically 0

also 0
drastically 0
increasing 0

is 0
classic 0

targeted 0
to 0

that 0
is 0
wary 0
of 0

pronouncements 0

In 0
response 0
to 0
such 0
criticisms 0
of 0
his 0

policies 0
, 0
AMLO 0
recently 0
released 0
a 0
communique 0
in 0
El B-Entity
Financiero E-Entity
, 0
in 0
which 0
he 0
called 0
on 0
the 0
business 0

to 0
confide 0
in 0
him 0
, 0
promised 0
austerity 0
, 0

responsibility 0
, 0
and 0
central 0
bank 0
independence 0
, 0
pledging 0

“ 0

” 0

It 0
certainly 0
sounds 0
reassuring 0
to 0
Mexican S-Entity
investors 0
, 0
but 0
it 0
still 0
fails 0
to 0
account 0
for 0
how 0
he 0
is 0
going 0
to 0
pay 0
for 0
all 0
of 0
his 0
new 0
spendings 0
, 0
with 0
already 0

And 0
like 0
all 0
populists 0
, 0
AMLO 0
has 0
much 0
to 0
say 0
that 0
is 0
music 0
to 0
working 0
- 0
class 0
voters’ 0
ears 0

but 0
little 0
to 0
say 0
about 0
considerable 0
inflation 0

that 0
reached 0
0.00 0

in 0
0000 0

would 0
only 0
worsen 0
if 0
AMLO 0
unleashes 0
profound 0
new 0
government 0

, 0
as 0
promised 0

Finally 0
, 0
AMLO 0
seeks 0
to 0
capitalize 0
on 0
the 0
anti 0

sentiment 0
in 0

how 0
then 0
did 0
this 0

The 0
prime 0

said 0
that 0
Trinidad S-Entity

failed 0
to 0
attend 0
a 0
preparatory 0
meeting 0
at 0
the 0

on 0

there 0
was 0
communication 0
between 0
the 0
Washington S-Entity
mission 0

the 0
ministry 0
in 0

, 0
on 0
what 0
position 0

should 0
adopt 0

The 0

said 0
that 0
following 0
discussions 0
back 0
and 0
forth 0
, 0
the 0
permanent 0
secretary 0
then 0
instructed 0
Ambassador 0
Phillips 0

Spencer 0
to 0
adopt 0
a 0
position 0
that 0

should 0
instead 0
seek 0

deferred 0
payment 0

of 0
the 0

heads 0
denied 0
one 0
nation 0
's 0
request 0
for 0
a 0
fee 0
waiver 0
, 0
partly 0
because 0
those 0
fees 0
would 0
have 0
fallen 0
on 0

Officials 0
at 0
the 0

Markets 0
have 0
been 0
volatile 0
but 0
there 0
are 0
few 0
signs 0
that 0

in 0

March 0
was 0
another 0
volatile 0
month 0
for 0

markets 0
. 0

The 0
Vix 0
measure 0
of 0
implied 0
equity 0
volatility 0
reached 0
00 0
per 0

, 0
double 0
the 0
subdued 0
level 0
seen 0
at 0
the 0
start 0
of 0
the 0
year 0

The 0
catalyst 0
for 0
this 0
development 0
was 0
the 0
announcement 0
by 0
President 0
Trump 0
of 0
tariffs 0
on 0
Chinese S-Entity
imports 0
totalling 0
$ 0
00bn 0
. 0

Another 0
factor 0
which 0
affected 0
the 0
equity 0
markets 0
was 0
weakness 0
in 0
technology 0
stocks 0
following 0
allegations 0
that 0
Facebook 0
may 0
have 0
misused 0
client 0
data 0

model 0

Taken 0
together 0
, 0
these 0
developments 0
wiped 0
out 0
the 0
recovery 0
seen 0
in 0
the 0
major 0
stock 0
indices 0
seen 0
since 0
February 0
’s 0

In 0

the 0
S&P000 0
, 0
NASDAQ 0

Nikkei 0

0.0 0

The 0
falls 0
in 0
overseas 0
equity 0
markets 0
were 0
larger 0
when 0
translated 0
back 0
to 0
sterling 0
, 0
reflecting 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
it 0
rose 0
between 0
0 0
and 0
0.00 0
per 0
cent 0
against 0
other 0
major 0
currencies 0
. 0

Elsewhere 0
, 0
economic 0
data 0
released 0
during 0
the 0
first 0
quarter 0
has 0
been 0
a 0
little 0
disappointing 0
. 0

We 0
have 0
seen 0
a 0
moderation 0
in 0
consumption 0
growth 0
and 0
a 0
downshift 0
in 0
manufacturing 0
momentum 0
. 0

This 0
reflects 0
a 0
combination 0
of 0
the 0
lagged 0
effects 0
of 0
higher 0
energy 0
prices 0
, 0
a 0
seasonal 0
bias 0
for 0
weaker 0
first 0
- 0
quarter 0
data 0
in 0
recent 0
years 0
and 0
adverse 0
weather 0
. 0

We 0
do 0
expect 0
much 0
of 0
this 0
to 0
be 0
reversed 0
in 0
the 0
second 0
quarter 0
but 0
, 0
for 0
the 0
time 0
being 0
, 0
this 0
has 0
been 0
a 0
headwind 0
to 0
the 0
equity 0
markets 0
ahead 0
of 0
the 0
upcoming 0
first 0
- 0
quarter 0
corporate 0
earnings 0
season 0
. 0

Against 0
this 0
backdrop 0
it 0
is 0
fair 0
to 0
say 0
that 0
the 0
narrative 0
in 0
financial 0
markets 0
has 0
become 0
much 0
less 0
upbeat 0
in 0
recent 0
weeks 0
, 0
as 0
investors 0
fret 0
about 0
a 0
possible 0
trade 0
war 0
and 0
the 0
risk 0
of 0
tighter 0
regulation 0
and 0
increased 0
taxation 0
of 0
the 0
large 0
technology 0
firms 0
, 0
so 0
some 0
short 0
term 0
caution 0
may 0
be 0
justified 0
. 0

In 0
addition 0
, 0
the 0
deceleration 0
of 0
economic 0
momentum 0
as 0
the 0
US S-Entity
Federal 0
Reserve 0
continues 0
to 0
tighten 0
monetary 0
policy 0
has 0
made 0
many 0
investors 0
worry 0
that 0
the 0
economic 0
expansion 0
seen 0
since 0
0000 0
may 0
be 0
nearing 0
an 0
end 0
. 0

At 0
this 0
juncture 0
I 0
shall 0
nail 0
my 0
colours 0
to 0
the 0
mast 0
and 0
say 0
that 0
I 0
do 0
not 0
think 0
that 0
there 0
is 0
currently 0
enough 0
evidence 0
to 0
support 0
the 0
late 0
- 0
cycle 0
thesis 0
. 0

As 0
a 0
consequence 0
, 0
and 0
despite 0
some 0
near 0
term 0
market 0
headwinds 0
, 0
I 0
also 0
feel 0
that 0
it 0
is 0
too 0
early 0
to 0
call 0
an 0
end 0
to 0
the 0
bull 0
- 0
run 0
in 0
equities 0
. 0

Why 0
do 0
I 0
think 0
this 0
? 0

Well 0
there 0
are 0
a 0
number 0
of 0
developments 0
one 0
would 0
expect 0
to 0
see 0
on 0
the 0
cusp 0
of 0
the 0
next 0
downturn 0
. 0

Here 0
are 0
the 0
main 0
ones 0
to 0
consider 0
: 0

Overheating 0
in 0
the 0
real 0
economy 0
, 0
evidenced 0
by 0
an 0
unwelcome 0
rise 0
in 0
inflation 0
, 0
which 0
causes 0
central 0
banks 0
to 0
tighten 0
monetary 0
policy 0
to 0
the 0
point 0
at 0
which 0
we 0
see 0
a 0
material 0
slowdown 0
in 0
activity 0
which 0
is 0
accompanied 0
by 0
weaker 0
corporate 0
earnings 0
and 0
poor 0
equity 0
market 0
returns 0
. 0

If 0
we 0
exclude 0
the 0
UK S-Entity
from 0
this 0
the 0
rise 0
is 0
inflation 0
has 0
stemmed 0
largely 0
from 0
the 0
one 0
off 0
effects 0
of 0
sterling 0
’s 0
0000 0
depreciation 0
inflation 0
, 0
particularly 0
in 0
the 0
developed 0
world 0
, 0
is 0
running 0
some 0
way 0
below 0
the 0
main 0
central 0
banks’ 0
targets 0
. 0

Whilst 0
the 0
US S-Entity
Federal 0
Reserve 0
has 0
begun 0
to 0
tighten 0
its 0
key 0
policy 0
rate 0
and 0
wind 0
down 0
it 0
quantitative 0
easing 0
programme 0
, 0
this 0
process 0
is 0
likely 0
to 0
be 0
a 0
gradual 0
one 0
. 0

Elsewhere 0
, 0
the 0
Bank 0
of 0
Japan S-Entity
and 0
the 0
European B-Entity
Central M-Entity

will 0
keep 0
policy 0
highly 0
accommodative 0
for 0
some 0
time 0

Equities 0
reached 0
all 0
- 0
time 0
highs 0
early 0
in 0
the 0
quarter 0
, 0
but 0
it 0
is 0
by 0
no 0
means 0
clear 0
that 0
financial 0
markets 0
have 0
been 0
fuelled 0
by 0
speculative 0
excess 0
. 0

Cash 0
levels 0
which 0
many 0
investors 0
have 0
been 0
holding 0
have 0
been 0
generally 0
high 0
and 0
leverage 0
( 0

the 0
cycle 0
matures 0
, 0
companies 0

increasingly 0
shareholder 0
friendly 0
behaviour 0
, 0
often 0
at 0
the 0
expense 0
of 0

involve 0
increasing 0
debt 0
levels 0
to 0
finance 0

buybacks 0

M&A 0
activity 0
. 0

This 0
may 0
begin 0
to 0
be 0
an 0
issue 0
for 0

because 0
whilst 0

rates 0

the 0
degree 0
of 0
leverage 0

is 0
rising 0
, 0
which 0
could 0
make 0
companies 0
vulnerable 0
to 0
rising 0
interest 0
rates 0
. 0

We 0
are 0
watching 0
this 0
factor 0
closely 0
. 0

Market 0
sentiment 0
is 0
clearly 0
fragile 0
and 0
the 0
