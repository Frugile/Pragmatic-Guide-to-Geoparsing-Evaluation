a 0

established 0

principles 0
that 0
would 0
guide 0
our 0

Trump 0
’s 0

: 0

to 0
protect 0

above 0
all 0
, 0
the 0
national 0
interest 0
, 0
our 0
sovereignty 0
and 0
the 0
dignity 0
of 0
the 0
Mexican S-Entity
people 0
, 0
and 0
. 0

Second 0
: 0
to 0
maintain 0
a 0
constructive 0
and 0
open 0
approach 0
that 0
allows 0
us 0
to 0
overcome 0
differences 0
, 0
face 0
common 0
challenges 0
and 0
reach 0
agreements 0
. 0

Our 0
actions 0
have 0
been 0
consistent 0
with 0
these 0
principles 0
. 0

The 0
Mexican S-Entity
government 0
has 0
worked 0
to 0
build 0
an 0
institutional 0
relationship 0
, 0
based 0
on 0
mutual 0
respect 0
, 0
that 0
is 0
beneficial 0
to 0
both 0
nations 0
. 0

On 0
that 0
basis 0
, 0
we 0
have 0
made 0
progress 0
in 0
the 0
negotiations 0
to 0
modernize 0
the 0
North B-Entity
American E-Entity
Free 0
Trade 0
Agreement 0
, 0
with 0
the 0
purpose 0
of 0
improving 0
the 0
competitiveness 0
of 0
the 0
region 0
and 0
creating 0
more 0
and 0
better 0
jobs 0
. 0

We 0
have 0
also 0
deepened 0
our 0
efforts 0
to 0
fight 0
transnational 0
organized 0
crime 0
, 0
which 0
severely 0
affects 0
our 0
communities 0
. 0

We 0
have 0
never 0
withheld 0
our 0
cooperation 0
, 0
because 0
we 0
are 0
aware 0
of 0
the 0
shared 0
responsibility 0
that 0
this 0
important 0
task 0
implies 0
. 0

And 0
, 0
of 0
course 0
, 0
we 0
have 0
defended 0
, 0
on 0
a 0
daily 0
basis 0
, 0
the 0
rights 0
of 0
Mexicans S-Entity
in 0
the 0
United B-Entity
States E-Entity
, 0
always 0
respecting 0
its 0
laws 0

The 0
bilateral 0
relationship 0
entails 0
enormous 0
opportunities 0
that 0
should 0
benefit 0
both 0
nations 0
. 0

It 0
is 0
an 0
intense 0
and 0
dynamic 0
relationship 0
, 0
which 0
understandably 0
also 0
poses 0
challenges 0
. 0

Nevertheless 0
, 0
these 0
will 0
never 0
justify 0
threatening 0
or 0
disrespectful 0
attitudes 0
between 0
our 0
countries 0
. 0

As 0
Mexicans S-Entity
, 0
we 0
may 0
disagree 0
among 0
ourselves 0
, 0
especially 0
during 0
election 0
periods 0
, 0
but 0
we 0
will 0
always 0
be 0
united 0
when 0
it 0
comes 0
to 0
defending 0
our 0
country 0
’s 0
dignity 0
and 0
sovereignty 0
. 0

This 0
is 0
why 0
, 0
in 0
light 0
of 0
recent 0
events 0
, 0
the 0
Mexican S-Entity
Senate 0
unanimously 0
condemned 0
the 0
offensive 0
and 0
unfounded 0
statements 0
concerning 0
Mexicans S-Entity
and 0
demanded 0
the 0
respectful 0
treatment 0
that 0
befits 0
a 0
relationship 0
between 0
countries 0
that 0
are 0
neighbors 0
, 0
partners 0
and 0
allies 0
. 0

The 0
candidates 0
currently 0
running 0
for 0
the 0
Mexican S-Entity
presidency 0
have 0
added 0
their 0
voices 0
to 0
the 0
Senate 0
’s 0
resolution 0
. 0

Despite 0
their 0
understandable 0
differences 0

they 0
all 0
agreed 0

all 0

that 0
run 0

to 0
those 0
that 0
befit 0

, 0
it 0

that 0
such 0

en 0

on 0

expelling 0
Russian S-Entity

is 0
an 0

The 0
fact 0
that 0

almost 0
three 0

more 0
diplomats 0
than 0
the 0

one 0
wonder 0

, 0
Cyprus S-Entity
and 0
Greece S-Entity
— 0
declined 0
to 0
take 0
similar 0
measures 0
does 0
n’t 0
change 0
the 0
overall 0
picture 0
. 0

If 0
, 0
let 0
’s 0
say 0
, 0
Italy S-Entity
had 0
joined 0
them 0
, 0
it 0
would 0
have 0
said 0
something 0
. 0

Italy S-Entity
has 0
always 0
been 0
the 0
most 0
authoritative 0
among 0
the 0
countries 0
that 0
come 0
out 0
in 0
favor 0
of 0
dialogue 0
with 0
Russia S-Entity
, 0
and 0
it 0
reacted 0
extremely 0
negatively 0
to 0
the 0
sanctions 0
war 0
. 0

But 0
this 0
time 0
, 0
apparently 0
it 0
was 0
explained 0
to 0
Rome S-Entity
just 0
how 0
important 0
it 0
was 0
to 0
demonstrate 0
solidarity 0
. 0

In 0
essence 0
, 0
Europe S-Entity
was 0
forced 0
to 0
support 0
the 0
“ 0
party 0
line 0
” 0
in 0
a 0
case 0
that 0
’s 0
still 0
anything 0
but 0
clear 0
cut 0
. 0

So 0
it 0
’s 0
possible 0
to 0
talk 0
about 0
the 0
success 0
of 0
the 0
U.S. S-Entity
and 0
Britain S-Entity
in 0
consolidating 0
Europe S-Entity
on 0
an 0
anti 0
- 0
Russian S-Entity
basis 0
. 0

Unfortunately 0
, 0
it 0
’s 0
too 0
high 0
- 0
profile 0
a 0
move 0
for 0
everything 0
simply 0
to 0
calm 0
down 0
and 0
return 0
to 0
normal 0
. 0

Most 0
likely 0
, 0
Moscow S-Entity
’s 0
response 0
will 0
soon 0
follow 0
. 0

Washington S-Entity
is 0
already 0
reacting 0
to 0
it 0
: 0
Washington S-Entity
has 0
said 0
that 0
a 0
response 0
by 0
Russia S-Entity
would 0
be 0
taken 0
as 0
an 0
escalation 0
. 0

In 0
essence 0
, 0
we 0
can 0
now 0
officially 0
acknowledge 0
that 0
we 0
’ve 0
entered 0
into 0
a 0
period 0
of 0
a 0
real 0
cold 0
war 0
, 0
with 0
all 0
the 0
attendant 0
consequences 0
. 0

However 0
, 0
this 0
cold 0
war 0
has 0
an 0
important 0
difference 0
from 0
the 0
previous 0
one 0
. 0

Forty 0
years 0
ago 0
, 0
although 0
Europe S-Entity
was 0
a 0
reliable 0
U.S. S-Entity
ally 0
, 0
all 0
the 0
major 0
European S-Entity
countries 0
— 0
France S-Entity
, 0
Germany S-Entity
and 0
Italy S-Entity
— 0
nevertheless 0
pursued 0
their 0
own 0
policy 0
line 0
and 0
had 0
room 0
to 0
maneuver 0
. 0

Now 0
the 0
Old 0
World 0
is 0
submerged 0
in 0
its 0
numerous 0
problems 0
, 0
and 0
in 0
foreign 0
policy 0
, 0
follows 0
the 0
U.S. S-Entity
lead 0
rather 0
less 0
willfully 0
. 0

Moreover 0
, 0
the 0
current 0
conflict 0
will 0
unfold 0
largely 0
on 0
the 0
economic 0
— 0
and 0
not 0
the 0
military 0
— 0
plane 0
. 0

It 0
means 0
sanctions 0
, 0
right 0
up 0
to 0
and 0
including 0
extremely 0
tough 0
sanctions 0
like 0
those 0
against 0
Iran S-Entity
, 0
and 0
cutting 0
Russia S-Entity
off 0
from 0
major 0
markets 0
and 0
capital 0
. 0

This 0
tactic 0
is 0
not 0
without 0
basis 0
, 0
because 0
unlike 0
in 0
the 0
days 0
of 0
the 0
Soviet B-Entity
Union E-Entity
, 0
our 0
country 0
today 0
is 0
part 0

, 0
and 0
every 0
such 0
blow 0
ca 0
n’t 0
help 0
but 0
impact 0

. 0

Tension 0
is 0
also 0
rising 0
in 0
the 0
area 0
of 0
public 0
opinion 0
. 0

The 0
image 0
of 0

as 0

rogue 0
nation 0
is 0
gradually 0
being 0
created 0

with 0
some 0
obvious 0
adjustments 0
for 0
the 0
scale 0

breaking 0
down 0

Although 0
Germany S-Entity

interest 0
in 0
the 0
pipeline 0

realization 0
remains 0
, 0
in 0

between 0

heard 0

that 0

process 0

How 0
can 0

respond 0
? 0

We 0
have 0
practically 0
no 0
means 0
of 0
pressuring 0
Western 0
countries 0
economically 0
– 0
with 0
the 0
exception 0
of 0

that 0
