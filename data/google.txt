is 0
even 0

some 0
of 0
these 0

been 0
recipients 0
of 0

controlled 0

The 0
post-1994 0
ANC 0
government 0
at 0
first 0
vacillated 0
about 0
defining 0
and 0
codifying 0
the 0
powers 0
and 0
status 0
of 0
chiefs 0
, 0
but 0
it 0
eventually 0
passed 0
legislation 0
that 0
significantly 0
increased 0
the 0
powers 0
of 0
chiefs 0
in 0
rural 0
local 0
governance 0
. 0

The 0
main 0
piece 0
of 0
legislation 0
that 0
did 0
this 0
was 0
the 0
Traditional 0
Leadership 0
and 0

Framework 0
Act 0
of 0
2003 0

the 0

geographic 0
areas 0
that 0
were 0
defined 0
by 0
the 0
apartheid 0
government 0
. 0

But 0
there 0
’s 0
ambiguity 0
around 0
what 0
powers 0
the 0
Act 0
actually 0
gives 0
chiefs 0
. 0

It 0
has 0
been 0
interpreted 0
as 0
giving 0
them 0
and 0
their 0
traditional 0
councils 0
powers 0
over 0
the 0
administration 0
and 0
control 0

In 0

the 0

grant 0

control 0
over 0

and 0
landed 0
resources 0
, 0
but 0
it 0
’s 0
been 0
interpreted 0
that 0
way 0

The 0
case 0
of 0
the 0
chiefs’ 0
control 0
over 0
mining 0
revenues 0
on 0
the 0
platinum 0
belt 0
epitomises 0

the 0
upper 0
hand 0

Over 0
the 0
past 0
30 0
years 0
a 0
new 0
trend 0
began 0
to 0
evolve 0
. 0

Local 0
chiefs 0
began 0
to 0
enter 0
into 0
deals 0
with 0
mining 0
companies 0
on 0
behalf 0

rural 0
communities 0
on 0
the 0
platinum 0
belt 0
. 0

Chiefs 0
, 0
as 0
assumed 0
custodians 0

became 0
mediators 0

led 0
development 0
and 0
mining 0

This 0
trend 0
can 0
be 0
traced 0
back 0
to 0
the 0
Bafokeng Entity

momentous 0

An 0

In 0

the 0

is 0
the 0

will 0

help 0

Just 0
as 0
there 0
is 0
no 0

that 0

equally 0
there 0

even 0
with 0
the 0

for 0

speak 0

will 0
create 0
identification 0

to 0
express 0
their 0

, 0
ways 0
of 0

If 0

takes 0

the 0
irony 0
of 0
developing 0
a 0

through 0
the 0

will 0
be 0
lost 0

Interaction 0

not 0
, 0
in 0

, 0
depend 0
only 0

It 0
depends 0
at 0

as 0
much 0
on 0
understanding 0
the 0
ways 0
of 0
life 0
of 0
others 0
. 0

Yet 0
language 0
teaching 0
does 0
not 0
pay 0
sufficient 0
attention 0
to 0
learners’ 0
cultural 0
competence 0
‒ 0
and 0
neither 0
does 0
the 0
EU Entity
. 0

Linguistic 0
competence 0
is 0
the 0
almost 0
exclusive 0
focus 0
of 0
attention 0
in 0
teaching 0
and 0
, 0
importantly 0
, 0
in 0
assessment 0
. 0

Setting 0
a 0
benchmark 0
for 0
linguistic 0
competence 0
and 0
its 0
assessment 0
is 0
an 0
inadequate 0
target 0
. 0

Only 0
when 0
competence 0
in 0
‘ 0

and 0
- 0
culture’ 0
or 0
‘ 0
languaculture’ 0
is 0
made 0
central 0
to 0
language 0

will 0
language 0
learners 0
be 0
able 0
to 0
use 0
their 0
languages 0
to 0
truly 0
interact 0
with 0
other 0
Europeans Entity
with 0
ease 0
, 0
identifying 0
with 0
them 0
through 0
common 0
interests 0
and 0
perhaps 0
acquiring 0
a 0
European Entity
identity 0
. 0

And 0
finally 0
, 0
there 0
is 0
the 0
question 0
of 0
English 0
. 0

Although 0
the 0
EU Entity
mantra 0
states 0
that 0
Europeans Entity
should 0
learn 0
‘ 0
mother 0
tongue 0
plus 0
two’ 0
, 0
the 0
reality 0
is 0
rather 0
that 0
young 0
people 0
want 0
and 0
are 0
offered 0
‘ 0
mother 0
tongue 0
plus 0
English 0
and 0
another 0
language’ 0
. 0

This 0
does 0
not 0
in 0
principle 0
radically 0
alter 0
all 0
that 0
has 0
been 0
said 0
above 0
, 0
were 0
it 0
not 0
for 0
Brexit 0
. 0

Although 0
English 0
will 0
remain 0
an 0
official 0
EU Entity
language 0
as 0
one 0
of 0
the 0

of 0

, 0
it 0
is 0
associated 0
above 0
all 0
with 0
the 0
United Entity

. 0

Furthermore 0
, 0
the 0
strong 0
status 0
of 0
English 0
in 0
the 0
EU Entity
has 0
been 0
implicitly 0
questioned 0
by 0
President 0

, 0
who 0
would 0
like 0
French Entity
to 0
gain 0
more 0

in 0

If 0

the 0
irony 0
of 0

through 0
the 0

will 0
be 0
lost 0
on 0
nobody 0

However 0
, 0
whatever 0
happens 0
in 0

will 0
be 0
tempered 0
by 0
the 0

recognition 0
that 0

by 0

can 0

rents 0
then 0
? 0

The 0
rent 0
, 0
a 0
hotel 0
owner 0
charges 0
, 0
depends 0
on 0
the 0
demand 0
for 0
the 0
hotel 0
rooms 0

For 0

, 0
If 0
the 0
demand 0
for 0
hotel 0
rooms 0
on 0
a 0
certain 0
day 0
was 0
less 0
then 0
the 0
rent 0
would 0
have 0
been 0
less 0

if 0
it 0

on 0
a 0
subsequent 0
day 0
the 0
rent 0
would 0
have 0
been 0

the 0

he 0

is 0

level 0

If 0
some 0
of 0
the 0

In 0

” 0

It 0
certainly 0
sounds 0
reassuring 0
to 0

it 0
still 0

account 0

like 0
all 0

to 0

that 0
is 0
music 0

little 0

reached 0

moderation 0
in 0
consumption 0

a 0
downshift 0

reflects 0
a 0
combination 0
of 0
the 0
lagged 0

a 0
seasonal 0

do 0
expect 0
much 0
of 0
this 0
to 0
be 0
reversed 0
in 0
the 0
second 0
quarter 0
but 0
, 0
for 0
the 0
time 0
being 0
, 0
this 0
has 0
been 0
a 0
headwind 0
to 0
the 0

ahead 0
of 0
the 0
upcoming 0
first 0
- 0
quarter 0

. 0

Against 0
this 0
backdrop 0
it 0
is 0
fair 0
to 0
say 0
that 0
the 0
narrative 0
in 0
financial 0
markets 0
has 0
become 0
much 0
less 0
upbeat 0
in 0
recent 0
weeks 0
, 0
as 0
investors 0
fret 0
about 0
a 0
possible 0
trade 0
war 0
and 0
the 0
risk 0
of 0
tighter 0
regulation 0
and 0
increased 0
taxation 0
of 0
the 0
large 0
technology 0
firms 0
, 0
so 0
some 0
short 0
term 0
caution 0
may 0
be 0
justified 0
. 0

In 0
addition 0
, 0
the 0
deceleration 0
of 0
economic 0
momentum 0
as 0
the 0
US 0
Federal 0
Reserve 0
continues 0
to 0
tighten 0
monetary 0
policy 0
has 0
made 0
many 0
investors 0
worry 0
that 0
the 0
economic 0
expansion 0
seen 0
since 0
2009 0
may 0
be 0
nearing 0
an 0
end 0
. 0

At 0
this 0
juncture 0
I 0
shall 0
nail 0
my 0
colours 0
to 0
the 0
mast 0
and 0
say 0
that 0
I 0
do 0
not 0
think 0
that 0
there 0
is 0
currently 0
enough 0
evidence 0
to 0
support 0
the 0
late 0
- 0
cycle 0
thesis 0
. 0

As 0
a 0
consequence 0
, 0
and 0
despite 0
some 0
near 0
term 0
market 0
headwinds 0
, 0
I 0
also 0
feel 0
that 0
it 0
is 0
too 0
early 0
to 0
call 0
an 0
end 0
to 0
the 0
bull 0
- 0
run 0
in 0
equities 0

Why 0
do 0
I 0
think 0
this 0
? 0

Well 0
there 0
are 0
a 0
number 0
of 0
developments 0
one 0
would 0
expect 0
to 0
see 0
on 0
the 0
cusp 0
of 0
the 0
next 0
downturn 0
. 0

Here 0
are 0
the 0
main 0
ones 0
to 0
consider 0
: 0

Overheating 0
in 0
the 0
real 0
economy 0
, 0
evidenced 0
by 0
an 0
unwelcome 0
rise 0
in 0
inflation 0
, 0
which 0
causes 0
central 0
banks 0
to 0
tighten 0
monetary 0
policy 0
to 0
the 0
point 0
at 0
which 0
we 0
see 0
a 0
material 0
slowdown 0

which 0
is 0
accompanied 0
by 0
weaker 0

we 0
exclude 0
the 0
UK Entity
from 0
this 0
the 0
rise 0
is 0
inflation 0

stemmed 0

Here 0

within 0

we 0
have 0
recruited 0

“ 0

By 0
so 0
doing 0
, 0
we 0
have 0
given 0

we 0
have 0
strengthened 0

If 0

put 0
it 0

there 0
was 0

say 0
, 0
Italy Entity
had 0
joined 0
them 0
, 0
it 0
would 0
have 0
said 0
something 0
. 0

Italy Entity
has 0
always 0
been 0
the 0
most 0
authoritative 0
among 0
the 0
countries 0
that 0
come 0
out 0
in 0
favor 0
of 0
dialogue 0
with 0
Russia Entity
, 0
and 0
it 0
reacted 0
extremely 0
negatively 0
to 0
the 0
sanctions 0
war 0
. 0

But 0
this 0
time 0
, 0
apparently 0
it 0
was 0
explained 0
to 0
Rome Entity
just 0
how 0
important 0
it 0
was 0
to 0
demonstrate 0
solidarity 0
. 0

In 0
essence 0
, 0
Europe Entity
was 0
forced 0
to 0
support 0
the 0
“ 0
party 0
line 0
” 0
in 0
a 0
case 0
that 0
’s 0
still 0
anything 0
but 0
clear 0
cut 0
. 0

So 0
it 0
’s 0
possible 0
to 0
talk 0
about 0
the 0
success 0
of 0
the 0
U.S. Entity
and 0
Britain Entity
in 0
consolidating 0
Europe Entity
on 0
an 0
anti Entity

Russian Entity
basis 0
. 0

Unfortunately 0
, 0
it 0
’s 0
too 0
high 0
- 0
profile 0
a 0
move 0
for 0
everything 0
simply 0
to 0
calm 0
down 0
and 0
return 0
to 0
normal 0
. 0

Most 0
likely 0
, 0
Moscow Entity
’s 0
response 0
will 0
soon 0
follow 0
. 0

Washington 0
is 0
already 0
reacting 0
to 0
it 0
: 0
Washington 0
has 0
said 0
that 0
a 0
response 0
by 0
Russia Entity
would 0
be 0
taken 0
as 0
an 0
escalation 0
. 0

In 0
essence 0
, 0
we 0
can 0
now 0
officially 0
acknowledge 0
that 0
we 0
’ve 0
entered 0
into 0
a 0
period 0
of 0
a 0
real 0
cold 0
war 0
, 0
with 0
all 0
the 0
attendant 0
consequences 0
. 0

However 0
, 0
this 0
cold 0
war 0
has 0
an 0
important 0
difference 0
from 0
the 0
previous 0
one 0
. 0

Forty 0
years 0
ago 0
, 0
although 0
Europe Entity
was 0

, 0
all 0

countries 0
— 0
France 0
, 0
Germany Entity

Italy Entity
— 0
nevertheless 0
pursued 0
their 0
own 0
policy 0

and 0
had 0
room 0
to 0
maneuver 0
. 0

Now 0
the 0
Old Entity
World Entity
is 0
submerged 0
in 0
its 0
numerous 0
problems 0
, 0
and 0
in 0
foreign 0
policy 0
, 0
follows 0
the 0
U.S. Entity
lead 0
rather 0
less 0
willfully 0
. 0

Moreover 0
, 0
the 0
current 0

unfold 0
largely 0
on 0
the 0
economic 0

and 0
not 0

It 0

right 0
up 0
to 0
and 0
including 0
extremely 0
tough 0
sanctions 0
like 0

against 0

off 0
from 0

This 0

not 0

I 0
address 0
you 0
today 0
on 0
a 0
matter 0
of 0
great 0
importance 0
for 0
our 0
country 0
. 0

I 0
am 0
talking 0
about 0
the 0
recent 0
events 0
that 0
affect 0
the 0
relationship 0
between 0
Mexico Entity
and 0
the 0
United Entity
States Entity
. 0

As 0
the 0
person 0
responsible 0
for 0
directing 0
the 0
country 0
's 0
foreign 0
policy 0
, 0
a 0
little 0
over 0
a 0
year 0
ago 0
, 0
I 0
established 0
two 0
fundamental 0
principles 0
that 0
would 0
guide 0
our 0
relationship 0
with 0
President 0
Donald 0
Trump 0
’s 0
administration 0
: 0
First 0
: 0
to 0
protect 0
, 0
above 0
all 0
, 0
the 0
national 0
interest 0
, 0
our 0
sovereignty 0
and 0
the 0
dignity 0
of 0
the 0
Mexican Entity
people 0
, 0
and 0
. 0

Second 0
: 0
to 0
maintain 0
a 0
constructive 0
and 0
open 0
approach 0
that 0
allows 0
us 0
to 0
overcome 0
differences 0
, 0
face 0
common 0
challenges 0
and 0
reach 0
agreements 0
. 0

Our 0
actions 0
have 0
been 0
consistent 0
with 0
these 0
principles 0
. 0

The 0
Mexican Entity
government 0
has 0
worked 0
to 0
build 0
an 0
institutional 0
relationship 0
, 0
based 0
on 0
mutual 0
respect 0
, 0
that 0
is 0
beneficial 0
to 0
both 0
nations 0
. 0

On 0
that 0
basis 0
, 0
we 0
have 0
made 0
progress 0
in 0
the 0
negotiations 0
to 0
modernize 0
the 0
North 0
American 0
Free 0
Trade 0
Agreement 0
, 0
with 0
the 0
purpose 0
of 0
improving 0
the 0
competitiveness 0
of 0
the 0
region 0
and 0
creating 0
more 0
and 0
better 0
jobs 0
. 0

We 0
have 0
also 0
deepened 0
our 0
efforts 0
to 0
fight 0
transnational 0
organized 0
crime 0
, 0
which 0
severely 0
affects 0
our 0
communities 0
. 0

We 0
have 0
never 0
withheld 0
our 0
cooperation 0
, 0
because 0
we 0
are 0
aware 0
of 0
the 0
shared 0
responsibility 0
that 0
this 0
important 0
task 0
implies 0
. 0

And 0
, 0
of 0
course 0
, 0
we 0
have 0
defended 0
, 0
on 0
a 0
daily 0
basis 0
, 0
the 0
rights 0
of 0
Mexicans Entity
in 0
the 0
United Entity
States Entity
, 0
always 0
respecting 0
its 0
laws 0
. 0

The 0
bilateral 0
relationship 0
entails 0
enormous 0
opportunities 0
that 0
should 0
benefit 0
both 0
nations 0
. 0

It 0
is 0
an 0
intense 0
and 0
dynamic 0
relationship 0
, 0
which 0
understandably 0
also 0
poses 0
challenges 0
. 0

Nevertheless 0
, 0
these 0
will 0
never 0
justify 0
threatening 0
or 0
disrespectful 0
attitudes 0
between 0
our 0
countries 0
. 0

As 0
Mexicans Entity
, 0
we 0
may 0
disagree 0
among 0
ourselves 0
, 0
especially 0
during 0
election 0
periods 0
, 0
but 0
we 0
will 0
always 0
be 0
united 0
when 0
it 0
comes 0
to 0
defending 0
our 0
country 0
’s 0
dignity 0
and 0
sovereignty 0
. 0

This 0
is 0
why 0
, 0
in 0
light 0
of 0
recent 0
events 0
, 0
the 0
Mexican Entity
Senate 0
unanimously 0
condemned 0
the 0
offensive 0
and 0
unfounded 0
statements 0
concerning 0
Mexicans Entity
and 0
demanded 0
the 0
respectful 0
treatment 0
that 0
befits 0
a 0
relationship 0
between 0
countries 0
that 0
are 0
neighbors 0
, 0
partners 0
and 0
allies 0
. 0

The 0
candidates 0
currently 0
running 0
for 0
the 0
Mexican Entity
presidency 0
have 0
added 0
their 0
voices 0
to 0
the 0
Senate 0
’s 0
resolution 0
. 0

Despite 0
their 0
understandable 0
differences 0
, 0
they 0
all 0
agreed 0
on 0
rejecting 0
all 0
measures 0
that 0
run 0
contrary 0
to 0
those 0
that 0
befit 0
good 0
neighbors 0
. 0

As 0
Ricardo 0
Anaya 0
pointed 0
out 0
“ 0
this 0
is 0
a 0
moment 0
of 0
national 0
unity 0

It 0
is 0
a 0

” 0
. 0

Andrés 0
Manuel 0
López 0
Obrador 0
declared 0
that 0
“ 0
we 0

not 0

not 0

among 0

” 0
. 0

José 0
Antonio 0
Meade 0
stated 0
that 0
“ 0

is 0

as 0

, 0
“ 0

As 0

I 0

of 0

The 0
Herald 0
Tourism 0
minister 0
Prisca 0
Mupfumira 0
recently 0
approached 0
British Entity
Airways Entity
( 0
BA Entity
) 0
regarding 0
the 0
possibility 0
of 0
direct 0
flights 0
between 0
London Entity
and 0
Harare Entity
but 0
was 0
turned 0
down 0
by 0
the 0
UK Entity
flag 0
carrier 0
, 0
it 0
has 0
emerged 0
. 0


 0

According 0
to 0
Zimbabwe 0
Tourism 0
Authority 0
( 0
ZTA 0
) 0
chief 0
executive 0
Karikoga 0
Kaseke 0
, 0
BA Entity
was 0
concerned 0
that 0
the 0
route 0
does 0
not 0
, 0
presently 0
, 0
have 0
enough 0
business 0
class 0
potential 0
to 0
complement 0
the 0
undoubted 0
economy 0
class 0
possibilities 0
. 0

Although 0
actual 0
numbers 0
remain 0
unclear 0
, 0
there 0
is 0
a 0
significant 0
Zimbabwean Entity
diaspora 0
in 0
the 0
UK Entity
and 0
many 0
regularly 0
travel 0
back 0
home 0
to 0
visit 0
with 0
their 0
families 0
. 0

However 0
, 0
it 0
would 0
appear 0
that 0
BA Entity
reckons 0
much 0
of 0
that 0
traffic 0
is 0
largely 0
economy 0
class 0
and 0
, 0
therefore 0
, 0
not 0
commercially 0
viable 0
. 0


 0

Britain Entity
used 0
to 0
be 0
a 0
key 0
source 0
market 0
for 0
Zimbabwe Entity
's 0
tourism 0
industry 0
, 0
but 0
visitor 0
numbers 0
collapsed 0
after 0
relations 0
between 0
Harare Entity
and 0
London Entity
suffered 0
a 0
Siberian 0
chill 0
at 0
the 0
turn 0
of 0
the 0
millennium 0
. 0

However 0
, 0
with 0
the 0
UK Entity
- 0
bashing 0
Robert 0
Mugabe 0
toppled 0
by 0
a 0
military 0
revolt 0
last 0
year 0
and 0
with 0
London Entity
apparently 0
taking 0
a 0
shine 0
to 0
the 0
new 0
Emmerson 0
Mnangagwa 0
administration 0
, 0
Zimbabwe Entity
tourism 0
authorities 0
sense 0
an 0
opportunity 0
to 0
get 0
back 0
into 0
the 0
graces 0
of 0
the 0
lucrative 0
British Entity
market 0
. 0

Hence 0
the 0
approach 0
to 0
BA 0
because 0
the 0
perennially 0
struggling 0
Air 0
Zimbabwe 0
appears 0
incompetent 0
at 0
the 0
task 0
despite 0
numerous 0
vows 0
to 0
resume 0
service 0
after 0
abandoning 0
the 0
route 0
years 0
ago 0
due 0
to 0
mounting 0
debts 0
and 0
the 0
seizure 0
of 0
its 0
aircraft 0
